									<p>Strictly within academia, I am most interested in machine learning, software engineering, and statistics. I've had the opportunity to work with tremendous amounts of data and build cool applications while interning at some awesome companies and making progress on my own personal projects. I've learned how to tackle the problems that come when working with data at scale and facing challenges that require flexible and sustainable solutions. Moving forward in my academic and professional career, I hope to continue to use technology to make better sense of our world. You can view my portfolio below. </p>
								</div>
								<div class="4u$ 13u$(medium)">
									<p>Outside of the classroom and work place, I enjoy exercising, staying in shape, and music. When I'm not hiking for a scenic view, I can usually be found playing pick-up basketball, or trying to learn to play an instrument. While I've really wanted to learn how to make music ever since I was little, I must admit that as of late, I have been listening to others' music rather than my own. Building the perfect Spotify playlist has been become one of my favorite pastimes. </p>

							<h2>Method to the Madness</h2>
						</header>
						<p> As a huge fan of college basketball, I decided to apply machine learning to the problem of predicting collegiate March Madness results. To tackle this, while at Big Red Hacks at Cornell University, I implemented a forward-feeding Neural Network in Java.</p>

						<p>In retrospect, I should have invested more time in data scraping and better overfitting techniques. Since then, I have learned a lot more and will probably revisit this project to improve.</p>
