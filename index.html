        <p>
            My name is Timothy Wang and I am currently a Sophomore studying Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park.
            <br>
            <br> Within the field of Computer Science, I am most interested in Software Engineering, Machine Learning, and Distributed Systems. Outside of the classroom, I enjoy playing sports like basketball and soccer, and exercising to stay fit. When
            I'm not coding or at the gym or field, I can be found hanging out with my friends or in my dorm either watching college basketball or episodes of <a href=https://www.netflix.com/title/70136120 target="_blank">The Office</a> over and over again.
            <br>
            <br> Recently, I've been spending a lot of time building a huge Spotify playlist filled with some of my favorite songs over the years. You can find this playlist <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/1222831100/playlist/4k61M0rMae2k176h3yQnt8"
                target="_blank">here.<a>
    I am also trying to start writing a blog. You can find that <a href = blog.html target = _blank> here</a>.

            <strong> Sift Science </strong>is a Y-Combinator alum and a high growth start-up specializing in machine learning fraud protection. At Sift, I worked on a variety of projects. Firstly, I implemented ~100 new features that helped improve our
            machine learning models. I also used MapReduce and Apache Crunch to cut down on feature extraction and model training times by over 90%. <br></br>

            My main project was to implement Naive Bayes text classification models. Although it was incredibly fun to write a Machine Learning model from scratch, Naive Bayes models are notoriously known for their simplicity. Thus, the real challenge was how to
            scale these models to handle 150 million transactions a day and over 12 TB of training data. Via distributed system frameworks and some clever programming, I was able to make these models very memory efficient and also very fast to train and
            generate predictions. It was extremely rewarding to have the opportunity to write a scalable Machine Learning system from scratch to finish, and also realize that I am helping protect billions of people from fraud every week.

            <br></br>
            <center><img src="computer_science.png" alt="logo"></center><br> In the 2017 Spring semester, I had the wonderful opportunity to TA <strong> CMSC132- Advanced Java & Data Structures. </strong> As a Teaching Assistant, I led two 1-hour discussions
            a week and also held 2 office hours per week. I wanted to TA CMSC132 not only because it was my favorite CS course, but also because it was the first I ever took at the University of Maryland. I benefitted a lot from a great teaching staff
            as a student, and I wanted to give back in any way I could. <br></br>

            As a TA, I planned instructional slides before every discussion session that either augmented what the professor went over in class or introduced new and interesting material. You can view those slides <a href=https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0B718gsB7x0asMmp4OG91UHZ6SHM
                target=_ blank>here</a>. TAing also sparked my passion for teaching and helping others. So, while during the course of the semester I taught my students about a collection of data structures and some advanced Java concepts, I learned so much
            more in return about maturity, empathy, and life. Many of my students and I are still close today.

            <center><img src="Cipher-Logo-Web.png" alt="logo"></center><br> At Cipher Systems, I was initially introduced to the .NET framework. Although I am still far from an expert, I found that my time at Cipher Systems taught me about a new paradigm of programming
            that is extremely widespread in industry. <br></br>

            At Cipher Systems, my main project was to provide some way to semantically tag news articles. Previously, Cipher relied on IBM Watson to do this, and that service was incredibly expensive. Using Stanford CoreNLP's natural language processing library,
            I wrote a NLP pipeline in Java that could replicate IBM Watson's role, thus saving the company quite a lot of money. This pipeline was eventually transformed into a Java microservice, and finally translated into C#.

            <center><img src="content-analytics-logo.png" alt="logo"></center><br> At ContentAnalytics, my main task was to help companies verify their inventories across all third-party retailer websites. Namely, these companies wanted to make sure that the
            pictures and information the third-party sellers had on their products matched their expectations. To tackle this, I wrote a Python script that utilizes a fleet of webcrawlers to perform image comparisons on thousands of images. I found the
            problem's lack of a closed form solution very fun, as it meant that I had to be creative and innovative in my approach.

            <center><img src="computer_science.png" alt="logo"></center><br> I investigated Pollard-Rho's semi-prime factoring algorithm. Factoring algorithms are incredibly important as the hardness of the problem is the basis for almost all cryptographic schemes.
            My team and I were able to cut down Pollard-Rho's runtime by a constant amount of about 97% and our version of his algorithm is potentially one of the fastest factoring algorithms for numbers less than 10^7.
