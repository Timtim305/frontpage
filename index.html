				<h1>Hi, I'm Tim.</h1>
				<br>
				<p>
					My name is Timothy Wang and I am currently a Sophomore studying Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park. I am a member of the Advanced Cybersecurity Experience (ACES) Honors College and QUEST Honors Program.
					<br>
					<br> Within the field of Computer Science, I am most interested in Software Engineering, Machine Learning, and Distributed Systems. Outside of the classroom, I enjoy playing sports like basketball and soccer, and exercising to stay fit. When I'm
					not coding or at the gym or field, I can be found hanging out with my friends or in my dorm either watching college basketball or episodes of <a href=https://www.netflix.com/title/70136120 target="_blank">The Office</a> over and over again. I have
					also started playing chess seriously for the first time since 5th grade, where I placed 5th in the State of Maryland. You can see my Chess.com account <a href=https://www.chess.com/member/twangggg target="_blank">here</a>.
					<br>
					<br> Recently, I've been spending a lot of time building a huge Spotify playlist filled with some of my favorite songs over the years. You can find this playlist <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/1222831100/playlist/4k61M0rMae2k176h3yQnt8" target="_blank">here.</a>					I am also trying to start writing a blog. You can find that <a href=blog.html target=_ blank> here</a>.

				<h2>Sift Science</h2>
				<h4>Summer 2017 Software Engineering Intern @ San Francisco, CA</h4>
				<p><strong> Sift Science </strong>is a Y-Combinator alum and a high growth start-up specializing in machine learning fraud protection. At Sift, I worked on a variety of projects. Firstly, I implemented ~100 new features that helped improve our machine
					learning models. I also used MapReduce and Apache Crunch to cut down on feature extraction and model training times by over 90%. <br></br>

					My main project was to implement Naive Bayes text classification models. Although it was incredibly fun to write a Machine Learning model from scratch, Naive Bayes models are notoriously known for their simplicity. Thus, the real challenge was how to
					scale these models to handle 150 million transactions a day and over 12 TB of training data. Via distributed system frameworks and some clever programming, I was able to make these models very memory efficient and also very fast to train and generate
					predictions. It was extremely rewarding to have the opportunity to write a scalable Machine Learning system from scratch to finish, and also realize that I am helping protect billions of people from fraud every week.</p>

				<h2>University of Maryland, Department of CS</h2>
				<h4>Spring 2017 Undergraduate TA @ College Park, MD</h4>
				<p>In the 2017 Spring semester, I had the wonderful opportunity to TA <strong> CMSC132- Advanced Java & Data Structures. </strong> As a Teaching Assistant, I led two 1-hour discussions a week and also held 2 office hours per week. I wanted to TA CMSC132
					not only because it was my favorite CS course, but also because it was the first I ever took at the University of Maryland. I benefitted a lot from a great teaching staff as a student, and I wanted to give back in any way I could. <br></br>

					As a TA, I planned instructional slides before every discussion session that either augmented what the professor went over in class or introduced new and interesting material. You can view those slides <a href=https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0B718gsB7x0asMmp4OG91UHZ6SHM
					    target=_ blank>here</a>. TAing also sparked my passion for teaching and helping others. So, while during the course of the semester I taught my students about a collection of data structures and some advanced Java concepts, I learned so much more
					in return about maturity, empathy, and life. Many of my students and I are still close today.

				<h2>Cipher Systems</h2>
				<h4>Winter 2016 Software Development Intern @ Annapolis, MD</h4>
				<p>At Cipher Systems, I was initially introduced to the .NET framework. Although I am still far from an expert, I found that my time at Cipher Systems taught me about a new paradigm of programming that is extremely widespread in industry. <br></br>

					At Cipher Systems, my main project was to provide some way to semantically tag news articles. Previously, Cipher relied on IBM Watson to do this, and that service was incredibly expensive. Using Stanford CoreNLP's natural language processing library,
					I wrote a NLP pipeline in Java that could replicate IBM Watson's role, thus saving the company quite a lot of money. This pipeline was eventually transformed into a Java microservice, and finally translated into C#.</p>

				<h2>Content Analytics</h2>
				<h4>Fall 2016 Software Engineering Intern @ San Francisco, CA</h4>
				<p>At ContentAnalytics, my main task was to help companies verify their inventories across all third-party retailer websites. Namely, these companies wanted to make sure that the pictures and information the third-party sellers had on their products
					matched their expectations. To tackle this, I wrote a Python script that utilizes a fleet of webcrawlers to perform image comparisons on thousands of images. I found the problem's lack of a closed form solution very fun, as it meant that I had to
					be creative and innovative in my approach.</p>

				<h4>Summer 2016 Undergraduate Researcher @ College Park, MD</h4>
				<p>I investigated Pollard-Rho's semi-prime factoring algorithm. Factoring algorithms are incredibly important as the hardness of the problem is the basis for almost all cryptographic schemes. My team and I were able to cut down Pollard-Rho's runtime
					by a constant amount of about 97% and our version of his algorithm is potentially one of the fastest factoring algorithms for numbers less than 10^7.</p>
